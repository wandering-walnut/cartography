# Cartography Rules

Cartography Rules is a security query library for your Cartography graph.

With the `cartography-rules` CLI, you can:
- Run pre-defined security queries across your infrastructure
- Identify potential attack surfaces and security gaps
- Explore and contribute community rules
- Build custom queries for your own environment


## Quick start

The prerequisite is a reachable Neo4j database that Cartography has already
populated. Rules query that graph directly; they do not require an input file
and do not write data.

Configure the connection if it differs from the local defaults:

```bash
export NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

If Neo4j was started with `NEO4J_AUTH=none`, no password configuration is
needed. Then list, inspect, and run a rule:

```bash
cartography-rules list
cartography-rules list object_storage_public
cartography-rules run object_storage_public
```

For an authenticated Neo4j server, set the default password environment
variable before running the same commands:

```bash
set +o history
export NEO4J_PASSWORD='your-password'
set -o history
cartography-rules run object_storage_public
```

Alternatively, keep the password in a custom environment variable or request
an explicit interactive prompt:

```bash
cartography-rules run object_storage_public --neo4j-password-env-var MY_NEO4J_PASSWORD
cartography-rules run object_storage_public --neo4j-password-prompt
```

If a named password variable is missing or empty, the command exits with an
actionable error instead of prompting. A typical text result reports each fact
and finishes with totals such as:

```text
EXECUTION SUMMARY
Total facts: 2
Total findings: 3
Rule execution completed with 3 total findings
```

Text output is intended for interactive review and includes sample findings.
Use `--output json` for complete, machine-readable results:

```bash
cartography-rules run object_storage_public --output json
```


## Architecture

The rules system uses a simple two-level hierarchy:

```
Rule (e.g., mfa-missing, object_storage_public)
  └─ Fact (e.g., aws_s3_public, missing-mfa-ontology)
```

**Rules** represent security issues or attack surfaces you want to detect (e.g., "Public Object Storage exposed on internet").

**Facts** are individual Cypher queries that gather evidence about your environment across different cloud providers and services.

This flat structure makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend the rules library.


## Design Philosophy

These rules are designed from an attacker's perspective. We ask: "What does an attacker actually need to exploit this weakness or gain access?"

The queries surface opportunities across the entire attack lifecycle: initial access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and persistence.

We don't impose arbitrary thresholds like "no more than 5 admins" because every organization has different risk tolerances. Instead, we surface facts:
- If a query returns no findings, you've eliminated obvious attack paths
- If it returns findings, you now have a clear list of potential attacker targets and security gaps


## Rationale

Security isn't one-size-fits-all. For example:
- An EC2 security group open to the internet may be risky for some orgs even if it isn't attached to an instance (someone could attach one later). For other orgs, that's irrelevant noise.
- IAM roles trusted across multiple accounts or S3 buckets with public access may or may not be material risks depending on your use case.
- User accounts without MFA might be acceptable in development environments but critical in production.

Our goal is to surface facts in context so you can decide what matters for your environment.


You can list all available rules and their details from the CLI, see [below](#list).


```{note}
Rules query against the existing Cartography graph. They don't write data; they return results you can view in text, JSON, or the Neo4j Browser.
```

## Rules Lifecycle

### Rule Versioning

Each rule has a semantic version number (e.g., `0.1.0`, `1.0.0`) that helps track changes over time:

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Breaking changes - query structure significantly altered, findings format changed
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): Additive changes - new facts added, expanded coverage to additional providers
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Bug fixes - query improvements, description updates

**Example lifecycle:**
```
0.1.0 → Initial release with AWS support
0.2.0 → Added Azure and GCP facts
0.2.1 → Fixed query performance issue
1.0.0 → Promoted to stable, all facts tested in production
```

When a rule's version changes, you can review the changes in the git history to understand what was modified and assess impact on your existing workflows.

### Fact Maturity Levels

Each fact has a maturity level that indicates its stability and production-readiness:

#### `EXPERIMENTAL`
- **Use case**: New facts, recently added, or covering new security patterns
- **Stability**: May have bugs, query performance not optimized, output format may change
- **Testing**: Limited production testing
- **What to expect**:
  - False positives/negatives possible
  - Query might be slow on large graphs
  - Results format may evolve
- **When to use**: Early adopters, testing new detection capabilities, non-critical analysis

**Example:**
```python
_new_attack_surface = Fact(
    id="aws_new_vulnerability_check",
    name="New AWS Vulnerability Pattern",
    description="Recently discovered attack pattern",
    cypher_query="...",  # must RETURN the affected node's id AS id
    cypher_visual_query="...",
    cypher_count_query="...",
    asset_label="AWSEC2Instance",  # Neo4j label of the affected node
    asset_id_field="id",           # output field holding that node's .id
    identity_fields=("id",),
    module=Module.AWS,
    maturity=Maturity.EXPERIMENTAL,  # New, needs testing
)
```

#### `STABLE`
- **Use case**: Production-ready facts with proven accuracy
- **Stability**: Well-tested, optimized queries, consistent results
- **Testing**: Extensively tested across multiple environments
- **What to expect**:
  - Reliable results with minimal false positives
  - Good query performance
  - Stable output format
- **When to use**: Production security monitoring, compliance reporting, automated alerting

**Example:**
```python
_proven_check = Fact(
    id="aws_s3_public",
    name="Internet-Accessible S3 Storage Attack Surface",
    description="AWS S3 buckets accessible from the internet",
    cypher_query="...",  # must RETURN the affected node's id AS id
    cypher_visual_query="...",
    cypher_count_query="...",
    asset_label="AWSS3Bucket",  # Neo4j label of the affected node
    asset_id_field="id",        # output field holding that node's .id
    identity_fields=("id",),
    module=Module.AWS,
    maturity=Maturity.STABLE,  # Battle-tested in production
)
```

### Filtering by Maturity

You can exclude experimental facts from your analysis:

```bash
# Only run stable facts
cartography-rules run object_storage_public --no-experimental

# Run all (including experimental) - default behavior
cartography-rules run object_storage_public
```

### Typical Fact Lifecycle

1. **Initial Development** (`EXPERIMENTAL`)
   - New fact created to detect a security issue
   - Basic testing in development environment
   - Community feedback gathered

2. **Refinement** (`EXPERIMENTAL`)
   - Query optimization based on performance testing
   - False positive reduction
   - Documentation improvements
   - Tested across diverse environments

3. **Promotion** (`STABLE`)
   - Proven accuracy across multiple production deployments
   - Query performance optimized
   - Output format finalized
   - Comprehensive test coverage

4. **Maintenance** (`STABLE`)
   - Bug fixes as needed
   - Query updates to handle new Cartography schema changes
   - Description clarifications

### Version and Maturity Together

Rules evolve over time. Here's how versioning and maturity work together:

```python
# Version 0.1.0 - Initial release
object_storage_public = Rule(
    id="object_storage_public",
    name="Public Object Storage Attack Surface",
    description="Publicly accessible object storage services such as AWS S3 buckets and Azure Storage Blob Containers",
    tags=("infrastructure", "attack_surface"),
    output_model=ObjectStoragePublic,
    facts=(
        _aws_s3_public,        # EXPERIMENTAL - new query
    ),
    version="0.1.0",
)

# Version 0.2.0 - Added Azure support
object_storage_public = Rule(
    id="object_storage_public",
    name="Public Object Storage Attack Surface",
    description="Publicly accessible object storage services such as AWS S3 buckets and Azure Storage Blob Containers",
    tags=("infrastructure", "attack_surface"),
    output_model=ObjectStoragePublic,
    facts=(
        _aws_s3_public,        # EXPERIMENTAL
        _azure_storage_public, # EXPERIMENTAL - newly added
    ),
    version="0.2.0",
)

# Version 0.2.1 - Bug fix
# AWS query fixed, no version bump for facts themselves

# Version 1.0.0 - Production ready
object_storage_public = Rule(
    id="object_storage_public",
    name="Public Object Storage Attack Surface",
    description="Publicly accessible object storage services such as AWS S3 buckets and Azure Storage Blob Containers",
    tags=("infrastructure", "attack_surface"),
    output_model=ObjectStoragePublic,
    facts=(
        _aws_s3_public,        # STABLE - promoted after extensive testing
        _azure_storage_public, # STABLE - promoted after extensive testing
    ),
    version="1.0.0",
)
```

## Usage

### Framework filtering

You can filter rules by compliance framework short name, optional scope, and optional revision:

```bash
# List all NIST AI RMF-mapped rules
cartography-rules list --framework nist:ai-rmf

# Run all NIST AI RMF-mapped rules
cartography-rules run all --framework nist:ai-rmf
```

The short name alone matches every scope and revision of that framework, so
`--framework cis` covers all four CIS benchmarks. Available filters:

| Filter | Framework |
| --- | --- |
| `cis:aws:6.0.0` | CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark |
| `cis:gcp:4.0` | CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark |
| `cis:googleworkspace:1.3` | CIS Google Workspace Foundations Benchmark |
| `cis:kubernetes:1.12` | CIS Kubernetes Benchmark |
| `iso:27001:2022` | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A |
| `soc2:tsc:2022` | AICPA SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria |
| `nist:ai-rmf:1.0` | NIST AI Risk Management Framework |

`cartography-rules frameworks` prints the live state: every scope, its revisions,
how many rules map to it, and each mapped control with its title.

### `list`
#### See all available rules
```bash
cartography-rules list
```

Output shows all rules with their IDs, names, and fact counts:
```
Available rules:
  - compute_instance_exposed (3 facts)
  - database_instance_exposed (4 facts)
  - mfa-missing (2 facts)
  - object_storage_public (2 facts)
  ...
```

#### See details of a specific rule
```bash
cartography-rules list mfa-missing
```

Output shows rule metadata and all associated facts:
```
Rule: mfa-missing
Name: User accounts missing MFA
Description: Detects user accounts without multi-factor authentication
Facts: 2
Version: 0.3.1

Facts:
  1. missing-mfa-aws (AWS)
     AWS IAM users that are not associated with any MFA device
     Maturity: EXPERIMENTAL
  2. missing-mfa-ontology (Cross-cloud)
     Active UserAccount nodes whose `_ont_has_mfa` is explicitly false
     Maturity: EXPERIMENTAL
```

#### See details of a specific fact
```bash
cartography-rules list mfa-missing missing-mfa-ontology
```

### `run`

#### Run all rules in text mode
```bash
cartography-rules run all
# or
cartography-rules run all --output text
```
![cartography-rules-run-all-text.png](../images/rules-text-output.png)


#### Run all rules in JSON mode
```bash
cartography-rules run all --output json
```

![cartography-rules-run-all-json.png](../images/rules-json-output.png)

#### Run a specific rule
```bash
cartography-rules run mfa-missing
```

#### Run a specific fact within a rule

```bash
cartography-rules run object_storage_public aws_s3_public
```

#### Exclude experimental facts
```bash
cartography-rules run object_storage_public --no-experimental
```

### Authentication Options

With no configured password, the CLI connects using Neo4j's no-auth mode and
does not prompt. `--neo4j-password-prompt` is the only option that requests
interactive input.

#### Use the default password environment variable:
```bash
export NEO4J_PASSWORD='your-password'
cartography-rules run mfa-missing
```

#### Use a custom environment variable for the password:
```bash
cartography-rules run mfa-missing --neo4j-password-env-var MY_NEO4J_PASSWORD
```

#### Use interactive password prompt:
```bash
cartography-rules run mfa-missing --neo4j-password-prompt
```


### Tab completion

Note that you can TAB complete. Install it with

```bash
cartography-rules --install-completion
```

and then restart your shell and then you can get TAB completion like:

```bash
cartography-rules list <TAB>
cartography-rules run <TAB>
```

This will show you all available rules and facts.

## Contributing New Rules

Want to add your own security rules? Here's how:

### Query Structure: cypher_query, cypher_visual_query, and cypher_count_query

Each Fact requires three distinct Cypher queries:

#### `cypher_query` - Data Query
Returns specific fields used to populate the output model. This query should:
- Use explicit field selection with aliases (e.g., `RETURN n.id AS id, n.name AS name`)
- Return only the data fields needed for the rule's output model
- Be optimized for data extraction and processing

**Example:**
```cypher
MATCH (m:CloudflareMember)
WHERE m.two_factor_authentication_enabled = false
RETURN m.id AS id, m.email AS email, m.firstname AS firstname
```

#### `cypher_visual_query` - Visualization Query
Returns nodes and relationships for Neo4j Browser visualization. This query should:
- Use `RETURN *` or explicit node/relationship returns (e.g., `RETURN m` or `RETURN *`)
- Include relevant relationships and context for visual exploration
- Help users understand the graph structure and connections

**Example:**
```cypher
MATCH (m:CloudflareMember)
WHERE m.two_factor_authentication_enabled = false
RETURN m
```

Or with relationships:
```cypher
MATCH (b:AWSS3Bucket)
WHERE b.anonymous_access = true
WITH b
OPTIONAL MATCH p=(b)-[:POLICY_STATEMENT]->(:AWSS3PolicyStatement)
RETURN *
```

#### `cypher_count_query` - Total Asset Count Query
Returns the total count of assets of the type being evaluated by the Fact. This query should:
- Count **all** assets of the relevant type, regardless of whether they match the Fact criteria
- Return a single value with `RETURN COUNT(...) AS count`
- Enable calculation of compliance ratios (e.g., "10 public buckets out of 100 total")

**Example:**
```cypher
MATCH (m:CloudflareMember)
RETURN COUNT(m) AS count
```

Or for S3 buckets:
```cypher
MATCH (b:AWSS3Bucket)
RETURN COUNT(b) AS count
```

This count query allows users to understand the scope of their environment and calculate what percentage of assets are affected by a security finding.

### General Query Guidelines

- Ensure your queries are efficient and optimized for performance on large graphs.
- Test your queries against realistic datasets to minimize false positives/negatives.
- Follow existing code style and conventions for consistency.

### Output Models with Pydantic

Each Rule must define an output model that extends `Finding`. This Pydantic model defines the structure of the data returned by the rule's facts.

#### Creating an Output Model

```python
from cartography.rules.spec.model import Finding

class MyRuleOutput(Finding):
    """Output model for my custom rule."""

    # Define the fields that will be populated from cypher_query results.
    # Declare a human-readable label first: the first non-empty field is used as the finding title.
    name: str | None = None         # Resource name (used as the finding title)
    id: str | None = None           # Resource identifier
    email: str | None = None        # User email (if applicable)
    region: str | None = None       # Cloud region
    public_access: bool | None = None  # Access level

    # Add any other fields relevant to your rule
```

#### Key Points

- **Inherit from `Finding`**: Your model must extend the base `Finding` class
- **Use Optional Fields**: All fields should be optional (`| None = None`) as different facts may return different subsets of data
- **Match Query Aliases**: Field names should match the aliases used in your `cypher_query` (e.g., if query returns `n.id AS id`, model should have `id` field)
- **Automatic Handling**:
  - The `source` field is automatically populated with the module name (e.g., "AWS", "Azure"). It is
    reserved: your query must not return a `source` column. For the per-row ontology provider, return
    `_ont_source AS ontology_source` and declare that field instead.
  - Fields not defined in the model are stored in the `extra` dictionary
  - Number values are automatically coerced to strings
  - Lists, tuples, and sets are joined into comma-separated strings
  - Dictionaries are serialized to JSON strings

#### Example from object_storage_public

```python
class ObjectStoragePublic(Finding):
    name: str | None = None
    id: str | None = None
    region: str | None = None
    public_access: bool | None = None
    account: str | None = None  # For Azure storage accounts

object_storage_public = Rule(
    id="object_storage_public",
    name="Public Object Storage Attack Surface",
    description="Publicly accessible object storage services",
    output_model=ObjectStoragePublic,  # Reference the output model class
    facts=(...),
    tags=("infrastructure", "attack_surface"),
    version="0.1.0",
)
```

### Finding identity vs. display fields

Output-model fields are for display and context. Many of them change over time even though the
underlying finding does not: counts (`active_key_count`, `super_admin_count`, `image_count`), dates
and usage flags (`days_since_rotation`, `last_used_date`, `is_stale_or_unused`), and aggregate
lists. If a downstream system that tracks finding lifecycle (first-seen time, acceptance/suppression,
ownership, issue correlation) keys on those volatile fields, the same finding reappears as new every
time a metric moves.

To give such consumers a stable contract, every `Fact` **must** declare `identity_fields`: the
subset of output-model fields that form the **stable logical identity** of a finding across syncs.
The field is required (no default), so a fact that omits it fails to construct.

```python
_aws_user_direct_policies = Fact(
    id="aws_user_direct_policies",
    ...
    asset_label="AWSUser",                        # Neo4j label of the affected node
    asset_id_field="user_arn",                    # that node's .id + failing-count driver
    identity_fields=("user_arn", "policy_arn"),   # one finding per attachment
)
```

Guidelines:

- Every field in `identity_fields` must exist on the rule's output model and be returned by the
  fact's `cypher_query`. `Fact.__post_init__` and a unit test enforce this.
- An identity must be **sufficient**, not merely present: two rows of the same fact must never
  share one identity. The shape that breaks this is a query that fans out over a to-many hop while
  the identity omits the fan-out column, so one asset yields several findings with one identity.
  A consumer keying findings on `(rule.id, fact.id, identity)` cannot represent that: it drops a
  finding or rejects the batch, and the rule silently reports nothing for the asset. Depending on
  what the extra rows mean, either fold the fan-out column into `identity_fields` (a GCP instance
  with an external IP on two NICs is two findings, so `("instance_id", "external_ip")`), or collapse
  the fan-out in the query with an aggregate (`collect`, `min`) or `RETURN DISTINCT` when the extra
  rows carry nothing new. `tests/unit/rules/test_identity_uniqueness.py` detects this statically and
  names both fixes when it fails.
- Never key on a property the ingest path leaves nullable. An identity field built from a
  soft-mapped value (`"arn": f.get("Arn")`) is null for every record the provider omits it on, so
  all of them collide on one empty identity. Prefer the property that backs the node's own `id`.
- Downstream lifecycle tracking should build its storage identity from `rule.id` + `fact.id` +
  the `identity_fields` values, so multi-fact rules cannot collide.
- For shared ontology labels (`:UserAccount`, `:DeviceInstance`, `:Tenant`, ...) a node id is only
  unique per provider: two providers can have distinct nodes with the same `id`. A cross-cloud fact
  that matches such a label must include a provider discriminator in `identity_fields`, returning
  `_ont_source` from the query under a name of its own (`... AS ontology_source`) and declaring that
  field on the output model. Do **not** alias it `source`: see the reserved fields below.
- `source` and `extra` are **reserved**: they belong to the `Finding` base model and are populated by
  `Rule.parse_results` (`source` from `fact.module`, `extra` from undeclared columns). A query column
  of either name would silently overwrite the framework-supplied value, so `Fact.__post_init__`
  rejects a `cypher_query` that aliases them.
- `identity_fields` is emitted per fact in the `cartography-rules run --output json` output (on each
  fact result, alongside `fact_id`), so JSON consumers get the contract without importing the
  Python rule registry.
- Every fact **must** also declare an affected-node anchor: `asset_label` (the Neo4j label of the
  node the finding is about) and `asset_id_field` (the output-model field holding that node's `.id`).
  Both are required and, together, form an indexable `(label, id)` anchor so consumers can locate the
  offending node in the graph. `asset_id_field` must exist on the output model and be returned by the
  `cypher_query` (`... AS <name>`); `Fact.__post_init__` and a unit test enforce this.
- The `cypher_query` **must bind a variable to the label it declares** (`MATCH (k:APIKey) WHERE
  k:OpenAIApiKey OR k:OpenAIAdminApiKey ...`, not `MATCH (k) WHERE k:OpenAIApiKey ...`) **and must
  project `asset_id_field` off that same variable** (`k.id AS api_key_id`). Both halves are needed:
  without the first, the rows a fact returns and the asset it claims can diverge; without the second,
  a query could match `(u:AWSUser)` and return an `AWSRole` id, so the `(label, id)` pair would name
  no real node. `Fact.__post_init__` enforces both, and a unit test additionally checks that
  `asset_label` is a label some node schema actually writes.
- Only the **final `RETURN`** produces output columns. An alias introduced by an intermediate
  `WITH x AS y` is query state and does not satisfy `asset_id_field` or `identity_fields`; conversely,
  a `WITH x AS source` is fine, since the reserved-name check also looks only at the final projection.
  A column may be named either by `... AS <name>` or by projecting a bare variable carried over from
  an earlier `WITH`.
- `identity_fields` is distinct from `asset_id_field`. `asset_id_field` is the anchor id **and**
  drives the distinct-asset failing count shown in compliance metrics; it is not the
  lifecycle-identity contract. The two can differ on purpose: `aws_user_direct_policies` anchors on
  and counts distinct users (`asset_label="AWSUser"`, `asset_id_field="user_arn"`) but treats each
  user/policy attachment as a separate finding (`identity_fields=("user_arn", "policy_arn")`).
- When the affected node has no single id column yet (e.g. a namespace-aggregated query), return one
  (`... AS namespace_id`) and point `asset_id_field` at it. When the node can be one of several
  labels, anchor on a shared umbrella label (`AWSPrincipal`, `GCPPrincipal`, `EntraPrincipal`,
  `ScalewayPrincipal`, `APIKey`, ...) rather than guessing a single subtype.
- `asset_label` and `asset_id_field` are emitted per fact in the `cartography-rules run --output
  json` output (alongside `identity_fields`), so JSON consumers get the anchor without importing the
  Python rule registry.

### Display field order (finding title)

The **order** in which fields are declared on the output model is a de-facto display contract.
Downstream consumers derive a finding's title by taking the **first non-empty rule-specific field
of the output model, in class declaration order**. Declaration order is independent of
`identity_fields`, `asset_label`, and `asset_id_field` (those stay whatever the identity and anchor
contracts need) and of the `cypher_query` `RETURN` order (the model is keyed by alias name, not
position).

The base `Finding` class declares two inherited fields, `source` and `extra`, before any
rule-specific field, so `model_fields` / `model_dump()` lists them first. They are metadata, not
display fields: a title-deriving consumer must **skip `source` and `extra`** and start from the
first field declared on the rule's own subclass. (The text runner's sample output at
`cartography/rules/runners.py` prints every field for debugging and is not the title consumer.)

Guidelines:

- Declare a **human-readable label first**: a name, `*_name`, `email`, domain, or title. Avoid
  leading with an opaque id, ARN, URI, digest, region, or a boolean: those make the title an
  unreadable string instead of the resource a user recognizes.
- A scope-level name (project/account/org) is only a good title when the finding's resource **is**
  that scope (e.g. a project-level or account-level check). For a resource inside a scope, lead with
  the resource's own name, not the project/account name.
- If the field would be **empty for every finding**, it cannot serve as the title even if declared
  first. For example a "missing CMEK key" check whose key field is null by definition: the consumer
  skips it and falls through to the next field.
- If the node has no natural name, **alias one in the `cypher_query`** and declare it first rather
  than leading with an id. Common patterns:
  - `coalesce(n.friendly_name, n.short_id) AS name`
  - an AWS `Name` tag: `OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[:TAGGED]->(t:AWSTag {key: 'Name'})` then
    `coalesce(t.value, n.id) AS name`
  - a stable user-chosen identifier (e.g. an RDS DB instance identifier) is already human-readable
    and fine as the first field.

```python
class DatabaseExposedOutput(Finding):
    """Output model for publicly exposed databases."""
    name: str | None = None    # human-readable label first: used as the finding title
    id: str | None = None
    region: str | None = None
```

### Steps to add a new rule

1. **Create a new rule file** in `cartography/rules/data/rules/`:
   ```python
   from cartography.rules.spec.model import Fact, Rule, Finding, Maturity, Module

   # Define facts with data, visualization, and count queries
   _my_aws_check = Fact(
       id="my_aws_security_check",
       name="My AWS Security Check",
       description="What this checks for",
       cypher_query="""
       MATCH (n:SomeNode)
       WHERE <condition>
       RETURN n.id AS id, n.name AS name, n.region AS region
       """,
       cypher_visual_query="""
       MATCH (n:SomeNode)
       WHERE <condition>
       RETURN n
       """,
       cypher_count_query="""
       MATCH (n:SomeNode)
       RETURN COUNT(n) AS count
       """,
       asset_label="SomeNode",   # Neo4j label of the affected node
       asset_id_field="id",      # output field holding that node's .id (returned above)
       identity_fields=("id",),
       module=Module.AWS,
       maturity=Maturity.EXPERIMENTAL,
   )

   ```python
   from cartography.rules.data.rules.my_rule import my_rule

   RULES = {
       # ... existing rules
       my_rule.id: my_rule,
   }
   ```

3. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   cartography-rules list my-rule
   cartography-rules run my-rule
   ```

4. **Submit a PR** - PRs welcome! ❤️
