# How to write a new intel module

If you want to add a new data type to Cartography, this is the guide for you. We look forward to receiving your PR!

## Before getting started...

Read through and follow the setup steps in [the Cartography developer guide](developer-guide). Learn the basics of
running, testing, and linting your code there.

## The fast way

To get started coding without reading this doc, use the AWS EMR implementation as an example. Its [ingestion code](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/intel/aws/emr.py) contains the API and sync functions, while its [declarative data model](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/aws/emr.py) defines nodes and relationships. For a longer written explanation of the "how" and "why", read on.

## Configuration and credential management

### Supplying credentials and arguments to your module

If you need to supply an API key or other credential to your Cartography module, we recommend adding a CLI argument. The CLI uses [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) with options organized into help panels per module. Add your options in `cartography/cli.py` following the existing patterns (e.g., Okta options). Credentials are typically read from environment variables and bound to Cartography's [Config object](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/config.py) which is available in all modules.

### An important note on validating your commandline args

Note that it is your module's responsibility to validate arguments that you introduce. For example with the Okta module, we [validate](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/811990606c22a42791d213c7ca845b15f87e47f1/cartography/intel/okta/__init__.py#L37) that `config.okta_api_key` has been defined before attempting to continue.

### Documenting module configuration

Every intel module must provide `docs/root/modules/<module>/config.md`. Keep the
page focused on the steps required to run the module and use the following
canonical structure. Omit optional sections that do not apply instead of
leaving empty headings.

```markdown
# <Module> Configuration

<!-- Briefly state what must be configured before this module can run. -->

## Prerequisites

<!-- Optional. List provider-side resources or tools that must already exist. -->

## Authentication

<!-- Required for API-backed modules. Explain how to create and supply credentials. -->

### <Authentication method>

<!-- Optional. Use subsections only when the module supports multiple methods. -->

## Required Permissions

<!-- Optional. Prefer a table for permissions. -->

## Optional Permissions

<!-- Optional. State which feature each permission enables. -->

## Configure Cartography

<!-- Required. Document environment variables, CLI options, and accepted values. -->

## Run Cartography

<!-- Required. Include at least one directly runnable command. -->

## Input Artifacts

<!-- Optional for report- or file-backed modules. -->

### Generate Input Artifacts

<!-- Optional. Explain how to create the artifacts Cartography consumes. -->

### Input Format

<!-- Optional. Document only setup-relevant format requirements. -->

## Advanced Configuration

<!-- Optional. Cover multi-account, multi-tenant, filtering, or alternate modes. -->

## Troubleshooting

<!-- Optional. Include only configuration-specific failures and remedies. -->

## References

<!-- Optional. Link to authoritative provider and Cartography documentation. -->
```

Use one H1 page title and start sections at H2. Order setup as prerequisites,
authentication, permissions, Cartography configuration, and a runnable command.
Store secrets in environment variables and clearly document `*-env-var`
indirection. Prefer tables for permissions or when documenting three or more
configuration options. Distinguish required permissions from optional
permissions and explain any graceful degradation.

Put module purpose, feature inventories, architecture, broad ingestion
behavior, and ontology integration in `index.md`. Put Cypher investigations in
`queries.md` or `examples.md`, and put post-ingestion analysis behavior in
`analysis.md`. Node, relationship, and property documentation belongs in model
docstrings and `PropertyRef.description`, which Sphinx uses to generate
`schema.md`.

## Sync = Get, Transform, Load, Cleanup

A cartography intel module consists of one `sync` function. `sync` should call `get`, then `load`, and finally `cleanup`.

### Get

The `get` function [returns data as a list of dicts](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/intel/gcp/compute.py#L98)
from a resource provider API, which is GCP in this particular example.

`get` should be "dumb" in the sense that it should not handle retry logic or data
manipulation. It should also raise an exception if it's not able to complete successfully.

### Transform

The `transform` function [manipulates the list of dicts](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/intel/gcp/compute.py#L193)
to make it easier to ingest to the graph. `transform` functions are sometimes omitted when a module author decides that the output from the `get` is already in the shape that they need.

We have some best practices on handling transforms:

#### Handling required versus optional fields

We should directly access dicts in cases where not having the data should cause a sync to fail.
For example, if we are transforming AWS data, we definitely need an AWS object's ARN field because it uniquely
identifies the object. Therefore, we should access an object's ARN using `data['arn']` as opposed to
using `data.get('arn')` (the former will raise a `KeyError` if `arn` does not exist and the latter will just return
`None` without an exception).

We _want_ the sync to fail if an important field is not present in our data. The idea here is that
it is better to fail a sync than to add malformed data.

On the other hand, we should use `data.get('SomeField')` if `SomeField` is something optional that can afford to be
`None`.

For the sake of consistency, if a field does not exist, set it to `None` and not `""`.

Neo4j handles fields in `datetime` format, so when a date is returned as a string, it's best to parse it to enable the use of operators during querying.

### Load

[As seen in our AWS EMR ingestion code](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/intel/aws/emr.py), the `load` function ingests a list of dicts to Neo4j by calling [cartography.client.core.tx.load()](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/client/core/tx.py):
```python
def load_emr_clusters(
        neo4j_session: neo4j.Session,
        cluster_data: List[Dict[str, Any]],
        region: str,
        current_aws_account_id: str,
        aws_update_tag: int,
) -> None:
    load(
        neo4j_session,
        EMRClusterSchema(),
        cluster_data,
        lastupdated=aws_update_tag,
        Region=region,
        AWS_ID=current_aws_account_id,
    )
```

```{tip}
When defining nodes and properties, please follow the naming convention below:
- **Node classes** should end with `Schema`
- **Relationship classes** should end with `Rel`
- **Node property classes** should end with `Properties`
- **Relationship property classes** should end with `RelProperties`
```

#### Defining a node

As an example of a `CartographyNodeSchema`, you can view our [EMRClusterSchema code](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/aws/emr.py):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EMRClusterSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
    label: str = 'AWSEMRCluster'  # The label of the node
    properties: EMRClusterNodeProperties = EMRClusterNodeProperties()  # An object representing all properties on the EMR Cluster node
    sub_resource_relationship: EMRClusterToAWSAccountRel = EMRClusterToAWSAccountRel()
```

An `EMRClusterSchema` object inherits from the `CartographyNodeSchema` class and contains a node label, properties, and a connection to its [sub-resource](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/core/nodes.py): an `AWSAccount`.

Note that the typehints are necessary for Python dataclasses to work properly.


#### Defining node properties

Here's our [EMRClusterNodeProperties code](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/aws/emr.py):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EMRClusterNodeProperties(CartographyNodeProperties):
    arn: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('ClusterArn', extra_index=True)
    firstseen: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('firstseen')
    id: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('Id')
    # ...
    lastupdated: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('lastupdated', set_in_kwargs=True)
    region: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('Region', set_in_kwargs=True)
    security_configuration: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('SecurityConfiguration')
```

A `CartographyNodeProperties` object consists of [PropertyRef](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/core/common.py) objects. `PropertyRefs` tell `querybuilder.build_ingestion_query()` where to find appropriate values for each field from the list of dicts.

For example, `id: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('Id')` above tells the querybuilder to set a field called `id` on the `AWSEMRCluster` node using the value located at key `'Id'` on each dict in the list. The `PropertyRef` argument is case-sensitive and names the source field, while the dataclass attribute names the Neo4j property.

As another example, `region: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('Region', set_in_kwargs=True)` tells the querybuilder to set a field called `region` on the `AWSEMRCluster` node using a keyword argument called `Region` supplied to `cartography.client.core.tx.load()`. `set_in_kwargs=True` is useful in cases where we want every object loaded by a single call to `load()` to have the same value for a given attribute.

##### Node property indexes
Cartography uses its data model to automatically create indexes for
- node properties that uniquely identify the node (e.g. `id`)
- node properties are used to connect a node to other nodes (i.e. they are used as part of a `TargetNodeMatcher` on a `CartographyRelSchema`.)
- a node's `lastupdated` field -- this is used to enable faster cleanup jobs

As seen in the above definition for `EMRClusterNodeProperties.arn`, you can also explicitly specify additional indexes for fields that you expect to be queried on by providing `extra_index=True` to the `PropertyRef` constructor:

```python
class EMRClusterNodeProperties(CartographyNodeProperties):
    # ...
    arn: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('ClusterArn', extra_index=True)
```

Index creation is idempotent (we only create them if they don't exist).

See [below](#indexes-cypher) for more information on indexes.


#### Extra node labels

You can add additional Neo4j labels to a node with `ExtraNodeLabels`. This lets
different node types share a query target without changing their primary
labels. First define an uppercase `ExtraNodeLabel` constant in the appropriate
label module. Then import that constant into each node schema that needs it.

For example, AWS IAM users, groups, roles, and federated identities all use the
`AWSPrincipal` label so queries can address them as AWS principals:

```python
from cartography.models.core.nodes import ExtraNodeLabel

# cartography/models/aws/extra_labels.py
AWS_PRINCIPAL = ExtraNodeLabel(
    label="AWSPrincipal",
    description="An AWS identity that can make authenticated requests.",
)
```

```python
from cartography.models.aws.extra_labels import AWS_PRINCIPAL
from cartography.models.core.nodes import ExtraNodeLabels
from cartography.models.ontology.labels import PERMISSION_ROLE

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AWSRoleSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
    label: str = "AWSRole"
    properties: AWSRoleNodeProperties = AWSRoleNodeProperties()
    extra_node_labels: ExtraNodeLabels = ExtraNodeLabels(
        [AWS_PRINCIPAL, PERMISSION_ROLE]
    )
```

This creates nodes with the labels
`(:AWSRole:AWSPrincipal:PermissionRole)`. The role remains addressable by its
primary `AWSRole` label and can also participate in queries for AWS principals
or permission roles.

`LabelKind.STANDARD` is the default for provider-local and shared graph
interfaces. Use `LabelKind.ONTOLOGY` for cross-provider semantic labels. The
`description` field provides metadata for introspection and generated
documentation; it does not change ingestion behavior.

Define each label once and reuse its exported constant. Raw strings are not
accepted. Cross-provider ontology label constants live in
`cartography.models.ontology.labels` and use `LabelKind.ONTOLOGY`;
provider-local interface labels should remain near their provider models.
`ExtraNodeLabels` accepts an iterable and stores the labels as an immutable
tuple.

#### Compatibility labels

Use a compatibility label only when renaming a node's primary Neo4j label. It
temporarily keeps the old label on newly ingested nodes so existing queries
continue to work during the migration period. The node is still supported
under its new primary label.

For example, CloudWatch log groups now use `AWSCloudWatchLogGroup` as their
primary label while retaining `CloudWatchLogGroup` until version 1.0.0:

```python
from cartography.models.core.nodes import LabelKind

LEGACY_CLOUD_WATCH_LOG_GROUP = ExtraNodeLabel(
    label="CloudWatchLogGroup",
    description="Compatibility label for the former CloudWatchLogGroup node label.",
    kind=LabelKind.COMPATIBILITY,
    replacement_label="AWSCloudWatchLogGroup",
    remove_in="1.0.0",
)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CloudWatchLogGroupSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
    label: str = "AWSCloudWatchLogGroup"
    properties: CloudWatchLogGroupNodeProperties = CloudWatchLogGroupNodeProperties()
    extra_node_labels: ExtraNodeLabels = ExtraNodeLabels(
        [LEGACY_CLOUD_WATCH_LOG_GROUP]
    )
```

`replacement_label` records the new primary label for introspection and
documentation. `remove_in` records the release in which the compatibility
label can be removed. Both fields are optional and are valid only when
`kind=LabelKind.COMPATIBILITY`.

#### Conditional node labels

```{warning}
Conditional labels are a specialized feature primarily used for ontology mapping scenarios where a single data source produces records that map to different semantic types. Most intel modules do not need this feature.
```

Sometimes the label depends on values in each data dictionary processed by the
loader. Compose a conditional value from an exported constant with
`CONSTANT.when(property_name="value")`. The keyword must name a property in
the node schema. The loader sets that node property from its `PropertyRef` in
each input data dictionary before the condition is evaluated.

For example, the ECR transform
[sets the `type` key on each image](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/99b77f07d946b38ac2ec720c30287d2a3faac5c5/cartography/intel/aws/ecr.py#L105-L114).
The
[ECR image schema uses that key](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/99b77f07d946b38ac2ec720c30287d2a3faac5c5/cartography/models/aws/ecr/image.py#L190-L196)
to select the matching ontology label:

```python
from cartography.models.core.nodes import ExtraNodeLabels
from cartography.models.ontology.labels import IMAGE
from cartography.models.ontology.labels import IMAGE_ATTESTATION
from cartography.models.ontology.labels import IMAGE_MANIFEST_LIST

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ECRImageSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
    label: str = "AWSECRImage"
    properties: ECRImageNodeProperties = ECRImageNodeProperties()
    sub_resource_relationship: ECRImageToAccountRel = ECRImageToAccountRel()

    # Apply different ontology labels based on the image type
    extra_node_labels: ExtraNodeLabels = ExtraNodeLabels([
        IMAGE.when(type="image"),
        IMAGE_ATTESTATION.when(type="attestation"),
        IMAGE_MANIFEST_LIST.when(type="manifest_list"),
    ])
```

**Primary use case: Container Registry Images**

ECR (and other container registries) store different types of artifacts that share the same base schema but have fundamentally different semantic meanings:

| `type` field value | Ontology Label | Description |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `image` | `Image` | Standard container image |
| `attestation` | `ImageAttestation` | SLSA/Sigstore attestation |
| `manifest_list` | `ImageManifestList` | Multi-arch manifest list |

Without conditional labels, we cannot accurately map these to distinct ontology
types. An `AWSECRImage` node with `type: "attestation"` should be labeled as
`ImageAttestation` in the ontology, not just generic `Image`. Production ECR
values are `image`, `attestation`, and `manifest_list`. Exact matching is
case-sensitive, so uppercase variants do not match.

**How it works:**
- Labels with empty `conditions` are applied unconditionally in the ingestion query's `SET` clause
- Labels with nonempty `conditions` are applied row by row in the same ingestion query, with a pair of `FOREACH` clauses that add the label when the conditions hold and remove it when they do not
- `when()` returns a new immutable label value and leaves the exported constant unchanged
- Conditions are stored as immutable, sorted `(field, value)` tuples
- Conditions use case-sensitive exact string equality and are combined with AND logic
- When conditions change, labels are automatically added or removed on subsequent syncs

**Important notes:**
- Condition values must be strings (e.g., `"true"` not `True`)
- Condition field names must exist on the concrete node's properties schema
- All conditions in one `when()` call must match for the label to be applied (AND logic). Declaring the same label more than once with different conditions is allowed: the label applies if any of the declarations matches (OR logic)
- Because labels are applied per row, only the nodes in the current batch are relabeled. A node whose conditions no longer hold is corrected the next time it is loaded, or deleted by cleanup if it is no longer reported
- Indexes are automatically created for conditional labels themselves. Condition fields are not indexed: they are evaluated against the already-bound node of the current row, so there is no lookup for an index to serve


(defining-relationships)=
#### Defining relationships

Relationships can be defined on `CartographyNodeSchema` through its [sub_resource_relationship](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/core/nodes.py) field or its [other_relationships](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/core/relationships.py) field (you can find an example of `other_relationships` [here in our test data](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/tests/data/graph/querybuilder/sample_models/interesting_asset.py)).

As seen above, an `EMRClusterSchema` only has a single relationship defined: an [EMRClusterToAWSAccountRel](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/aws/emr.py):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
# (:AWSEMRCluster)<-[:RESOURCE]-(:AWSAccount)
class EMRClusterToAWSAccountRel(CartographyRelSchema):
    target_node_label: str = 'AWSAccount'  # (1)
    target_node_matcher: TargetNodeMatcher = make_target_node_matcher(  # (2)
        {'id': PropertyRef('AccountId', set_in_kwargs=True)},
    )
    direction: LinkDirection = LinkDirection.INWARD  # (3)
    rel_label: str = "RESOURCE"  # (4)
    properties: EMRClusterToAWSAccountRelRelProperties = EMRClusterToAWSAccountRelRelProperties()  #  (5)
```

This class is best described by explaining how it is processed: `build_ingestion_query()` will traverse the `EMRClusterSchema` to its `sub_resource_relationship` field and find the above `EMRClusterToAWSAccountRel` object. With this information, we know to
- draw a relationship to an `AWSAccount` node (1) using the label "`RESOURCE`" (4)
- by matching on the AWSAccount's "`id`" field" (2)
- where the relationship [directionality](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/core/relationships.py) is pointed _inward_ toward the AWSEMRCluster (3)
- making sure to define a set of properties for the relationship (5). The [full example RelProperties](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/aws/emr.py) is very short:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EMRClusterToAWSAccountRelRelProperties(CartographyRelProperties):
    lastupdated: PropertyRef = PropertyRef('lastupdated', set_in_kwargs=True)
```

```{important}
**Relationship Naming Guidelines**

When naming relationships in Cartography:
- Prefer clear verbs (e.g., OWNS, CONTAINS)
- Avoid ambiguous or passive phrasing (e.g., IS, CAN)
- Use direct and active forms
    - Prefer OWNS over OWNED_BY
    - Prefer CONTAINS over BELONGS_TO

Consistent, action-oriented naming improves graph readability and makes Cypher queries more intuitive.
```

### Sub-Resources relationship

A *sub-resource* is a specific type of composition relationship in which a node "belongs to" a higher-level entity such as an Account, Subscription, etc.

Examples:

* In **AWS**, the parent is typically an `AWSAccount`.
* In **Azure**, it's a `Tenant` or `Subscription`.
* In **GCP**, it's a `GCPProject`.

To define a sub-resource relationship, use the `sub_resource_relationship` property on the node class. It must follow these constraints:

* The target node matcher must have `set_in_kwargs=True` (required for auto-cleanup functionality).
* All `sub_resource_relationship`s must:

  * Use the label `RESOURCE`
  * Have the direction set to `INWARD`
* Each module:

  * **Must have at least one root node** (a node without a `sub_resource_relationship`)
  * **Must have at most one root node**

#### Common Relationship Types

While you're free to define custom relationships, using standardized types improves maintainability and facilitates querying and analysis.

**Composition**

* `(:Parent)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Child)`
* `(:Parent)-[:HAS]->(:Child)`

**Tagging**

* `(:Entity)-[:TAGGED]->(:Tag)`

**Group Membership**

* `(:Element)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:Group)`
* `(:Element)-[:ADMIN_OF]->(:Group)`
    ```{note}
    If an element is an admin, both relationships (`MEMBER_OF` and `ADMIN_OF`) should be present for consistency.
    ```

**Ownership**

* `(:Entity)-[:OWNS]->(:OtherEntity)`

**Permissions (ACL)**

* `(:Actor)-[:CAN_ACCESS]->(:Entity)`
* `(:Actor)-[:CAN_READ]->(:Entity)`
* `(:Actor)-[:CAN_WRITE]->(:Entity)`
* `(:Actor)-[:CAN_ADD]->(:Entity)`
* `(:Actor)-[:CAN_DELETE]->(:Entity)`

#### The result

And those are all the objects necessary for this example! The resulting query will look something like this:

```cypher
UNWIND $DictList AS item
    MERGE (i:AWSEMRCluster{id: item.Id})
    ON CREATE SET i.firstseen = timestamp()
    SET
        i.lastupdated = $lastupdated,
        i.arn = item.ClusterArn
        // ...

        WITH i, item
        CALL {
            WITH i, item

            OPTIONAL MATCH (j:AWSAccount{id: $AccountId})
            WITH i, item, j WHERE j IS NOT NULL
            MERGE (i)<-[r:RESOURCE]-(j)
            ON CREATE SET r.firstseen = timestamp()
            SET
                r.lastupdated = $lastupdated
        }
```

And that's basically all you need to know to understand how to define your own nodes and relationships using cartography's data objects. For more information, view the [model API documentation](../references/model) as a reference.

### Additional concepts

This section explains cartography general patterns, conventions, and design decisions.

#### cartography's `update_tag`:

`cartography`'s global config object carries around an `update_tag` property which is a tag/label associated with the current sync. Cartography's sync code [sets this to a Unix timestamp of when the sync was started](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/sync.py).

All `cartography` intel modules set the `lastupdated` property on all nodes and all relationships to this `update_tag`.


#### All nodes need these fields

- <a name="id">id</a> - an ID should be a string that uniquely identifies the node. In AWS, this is usually an
    ARN. In GCP, this is usually a partial URI.

    If possible, we should use API-provided fields for IDs and not create our own.
    In some cases though this is unavoidable -
    see [GCPNetworkTag](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/docs/schema/gcp.md#gcpnetworktag).

    When setting an `id`, ensure that you also include the field name that it came from. For example, since we've
    decided to use `partial_uri`s as an id for a GCPVpc,  we should include both `partial_uri` _and_ `id` on the node.
    This way, a user can tell what fields were used to derive the `id`. This is accomplished [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/intel/gcp/compute.py#L455-L457)

- `lastupdated` - See [below](#lastupdated-and-firstseen) on how this gets set automatically.
- `firstseen` - See [below](#lastupdated-and-firstseen) on how this gets set automatically.

#### All relationships need these fields

Keep relationships lightweight unless an ingestion or query path requires additional properties. Standard relationships typically contain these two fields:

- `lastupdated` - See [below](#lastupdated-and-firstseen) on how this gets set automatically.
- `firstseen` - See [below](#lastupdated-and-firstseen) on how this gets set automatically.

For MatchLinks loaded with `load_matchlinks()`, Cartography also creates a composite relationship index on `_sub_resource_label` and `_sub_resource_id`. Those stable keys support scoped cleanup; `lastupdated` is deliberately excluded because it changes on every sync.

#### Run queries only on indexed fields for best performance

In this older example of ingesting GCP VPCs, we connect VPCs with GCPProjects
[based on their id fields](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/intel/gcp/compute.py#L451).
`id`s are indexed, as seen [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/indexes.cypher#L45)
and [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/indexes.cypher#L42).
All of these queries use indexes for faster lookup.

(indexes-cypher)=
#### indexes.cypher

Older intel modules define indexes in [indexes.cypher](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/indexes.cypher).
By using CartographyNodeSchema and CartographyRelSchema objects, indexes are automatically created so you don't need to update this file!


(lastupdated-and-firstseen)=
#### lastupdated and firstseen

On every cartography node and relationship, we set the `lastupdated` field to the `UPDATE_TAG` and `firstseen` field to `timestamp()` (a built-in Neo4j function equivalent to epoch time in milliseconds). This is automatically handled by the cartography object model.

#### One-to-many relationships
We can use the Cartography data model to represent one-to-many relationships. For example, an AWS IAM instance profile
([API docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_InstanceProfile.html)) maps to one or more roles.

An example instance profile object looks like this:

```python
INSTANCE_PROFILES = [
    {
        "Path": "/",
        "InstanceProfileName": "my-instance-profile",
        "InstanceProfileId": "AIPA4SD",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234:instance-profile/my-instance-profile",
        "CreateDate": datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 21, 23, 54, 16),
        "Roles": [
            {
                "Path": "/",
                "RoleName": "role1",
                "RoleId": "AROA4",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234:role/role1",
                "CreateDate": datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 21, 6, 53, 29),
            },
            {
                "Path": "/",
                "RoleName": "role2",
                "RoleId": "AROA5",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234:role/role2",
                "CreateDate": datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 21, 6, 53, 29),
            },
        ],
    },
]
```

Note that the `Roles` field in this data object is a list of objects (and that this is a one-to-many setup).

Here's how to represent this in the Cartography data model:

  1. Transform the data so that `Roles` becomes a list of IDs and not dicts. Here we will use ARNs. The result should be:

      ```python
      TRANSFORMED_INSTANCE_PROFILES = [
          {
              "Path": "/",
              "InstanceProfileName": "my-instance-profile",
              "InstanceProfileId": "AIPA4SD",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234:instance-profile/my-instance-profile",
              "CreateDate": datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 21, 23, 54, 16),
              "Roles": [
                  "arn:aws:iam::1234:role/role1",
                  "arn:aws:iam::1234:role/role2",
              ]
          },
      ]
      ```

  1. Define the InstanceProfile node (irrelevant fields omitted for brevity):

      ```python
      @dataclass(frozen=True)
      class InstanceProfileSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
          label: str = 'AWSInstanceProfile'
          properties: ...
          sub_resource_relationship: ...
          other_relationships: OtherRelationships = OtherRelationships([
              InstanceProfileToAWSRoleRel(),
          ])
      ```

  1. Define its association with AWS roles

      ```python
      @dataclass(frozen=True)
      class InstanceProfileToAWSRoleRel(CartographyRelSchema):
          target_node_label: str = 'AWSRole'
          target_node_matcher: TargetNodeMatcher = make_target_node_matcher(
              {'arn': PropertyRef('Roles', one_to_many=True)},
          )
          direction: LinkDirection = LinkDirection.OUTWARD
          rel_label: str = "ASSOCIATED_WITH"
          properties: ...
      ```

        The key part is setting `one_to_many=True` in the PropertyRef for the TargetNodeMatcher. This instructs the data model
        to look for AWSRoles in the graph where their `arn` field is in the list pointed to by the `Roles` key on the data dict.

Now we can use the same steps described above in this doc to finish data ingestion.

### MatchLinks

See [the MatchLinks documentation](matchlinks) on how to connect existing nodes in the graph together using Cartography's data model.


### Cleanup

We have just added new nodes and relationships to the graph, and we have also updated previously-added ones
by using `MERGE`. We now need to delete nodes and relationships that no longer exist, and we do this by removing
all nodes and relationships that have `lastupdated` NOT set to the `update_tag` of this current run.

By using Cartography schema objects, a cleanup function is [trivial to write](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/intel/aws/emr.py):

```python
def cleanup(neo4j_session: neo4j.Session, common_job_parameters: Dict) -> None:
    logger.debug("Running EMR cleanup job.")
    cleanup_job = GraphJob.from_node_schema(EMRClusterSchema(), common_job_parameters)
    cleanup_job.run(neo4j_session)
```

#### Scoped cleanups

By default, a node_schema has `scoped_cleanup` flag set to True. This means that when we run a clean up job on that
node type, then we will only delete stale nodes that are connected to the current sub-resource being synced. This is
designed for modules like AWS or GCP where there a clear definition of a "tenant"-like object because each account or
project gets synced in one at a time and it doesn't make sense to delete objects outside of the current tenant being
synced.

For some other modules that don't have a clear tenant-like relationship, you can set `scoped_cleanup` to False on the
node_schema. This might make sense for a vuln scanner module where there is no logical tenant object.

#### Hierarchical data and cascade_delete

Some data sources have multi-tier hierarchical structures where nodes own other nodes via RESOURCE relationships. Examples include:

- **GCP**: Organization → Folders → Projects → Compute instances, Storage buckets, etc.
- **GitLab**: Organization → Groups → Projects → Branches, Dependencies, etc.

In Cartography, RESOURCE relationships point from parent to child:

```
(Parent)-[:RESOURCE]->(Child)
```

When a parent node becomes stale and is deleted, you may want its children to be deleted as well. The `cascade_delete` parameter enables this behavior:

```python
def cleanup(neo4j_session: neo4j.Session, common_job_parameters: Dict) -> None:
    cleanup_job = GraphJob.from_node_schema(
        MyParentSchema(),
        common_job_parameters,
        cascade_delete=True,  # Also delete children when parent is stale
    )
    cleanup_job.run(neo4j_session)
```

When `cascade_delete=True`, the cleanup query becomes:

```cypher
WHERE n.lastupdated <> $UPDATE_TAG
WITH n LIMIT $LIMIT_SIZE
OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[:RESOURCE]->(child)
WHERE child IS NULL OR child.lastupdated <> $UPDATE_TAG
DETACH DELETE child, n;
```

**When to use cascade_delete:**

- Use `cascade_delete=True` when child nodes are meaningless without their parent (e.g., GitLab branches without their project)
- Use `cascade_delete=False` (default) when children should persist independently or when another module manages their lifecycle

**Important notes:**

- Only affects direct children (one level deep via `RESOURCE` relationships). Grandchildren require cleaning up intermediate levels first.
- Children that were re-parented in the current sync (matching `UPDATE_TAG`) are protected from deletion.
- Only valid with scoped cleanup (`scoped_cleanup=True`). Unscoped cleanups will raise an error if `cascade_delete=True`.
- Default is `False` for backward compatibility.

#### Legacy notes

Older intel modules still do this process with hand-written cleanup jobs that work like this:

- Delete all old nodes

    You can see this in our [GCP VPCs example](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/jobs/cleanup/gcp_compute_vpc_cleanup.json#L4).
    We run `DETACH DELETE` to delete an old node and disconnect it from all other nodes.

- Delete all old relationships

   You can see this in the GCP VPC example [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/jobs/cleanup/gcp_compute_vpc_cleanup.json#L10)
   and [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/8d60311a10156cd8aa16de7e1fe3e109cc3eca0f/cartography/data/jobs/cleanup/gcp_compute_vpc_cleanup.json#L16).

   - Q: We just `DETACH DELETE`'d the node. Why do we need to delete the relationships too?

   - A: There are cases where the node may continue to exist but the relationships between it and other nodes have changed.
       Explicitly deleting stale relationships accounts for this case.
       See this [short discussion](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/pull/124/files#r312277725).

## Error handling principles

- Don't catch the base Exception class when error handling because it makes problems difficult to trace.

- Do catch the narrowest possible class of exception.

- Only catch exceptions when your code can resolve the issue. Otherwise, allow exceptions to bubble up.

## Schema documentation

Do not create or edit a module's `schema.md` manually. Sphinx generates schema
pages from the declarative data model. Add a docstring to every node and
relationship schema, and add a human-readable `description=` to every displayed
`PropertyRef`. Update these model definitions whenever the graph schema
changes.

## Making tests

- Before making tests, read through and follow the setup steps in [the Cartography developer guide](developer-guide).

- Add fake data for testing at `tests/data`. We can see
the AWS EC2 instance example [here](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/d42253b9223ced996fa9c51dee3a51942e0a08f4/tests/data/aws/ec2/instances.py#L4).

- If needed, add unit tests to `tests/unit/cartography/intel`. As seen in this GCP [example](https://github.com/lyft/cartography/blob/828ed600f2b14adae9d0b78ef82de0acaf24b86a/tests/unit/cartography/intel/gcp/test_compute.py),
  these tests ensure that `transform*` manipulates the data in expected ways.

- Add integration tests to `tests/integration/cartography/intel`. See this AWS EC2 instance [example](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/tests/integration/cartography/intel/aws/ec2/test_ec2_instances.py).
  By default, integration tests start a disposable Neo4j test container and
  verify that the loaded nodes and relationships match the mock data. Docker
  must be running. To use an existing Neo4j instance instead, set `NEO4J_URL`;
  integration tests delete all nodes from that database.

## Other

- We prefer and will accept PRs which incrementally add information from a particular data source. Incomplete
representations are OK provided they are consistent over time. For example, we don't sync 100% of AWS resources but the
resources that exist in the graph don't change across syncs.

- Each intel module offers its own view of the graph

    ```{note}
    This best practice is a little less precise, so if you've gotten to this point and you need clarification, just submit your PR and ask us.
    ```

    As much as possible, each intel module should ingest data without assuming that a different module will ingest the
    same data. Explained another way, each module should "offer its own perspective" on the data. We believe doing this
    gives us a more complete graph. Below are some key guidelines clarifying and justifying this design choice.

- It is possible (and encouraged) for more than one intel module to modify the same node type. However, there are two distinct patterns for this:

    **Simple Relationship Pattern**: When data type A only refers to data type B by an ID without providing additional properties about B, we can just define a relationship schema. This way when A is loaded, the relationship schema performs a `MATCH` to find and connect to existing nodes of type B.

    For example, when an RDS instance refers to EC2 security groups by ID, we create a relationship from the RDS instance to the security group nodes, since the RDS API doesn't provide additional properties about the security groups beyond their IDs.

    ```python
    # RDS Instance refers to Security Groups by ID only
    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class RDSInstanceToSecurityGroupRel(CartographyRelSchema):
        target_node_label: str = "AWSEC2SecurityGroup"
        target_node_matcher: TargetNodeMatcher = make_target_node_matcher({
            "id": PropertyRef("SecurityGroupId"),  # Just the ID, no additional properties
        })
        direction: LinkDirection = LinkDirection.OUTWARD
        rel_label: str = "MEMBER_OF_EC2_SECURITY_GROUP"
        properties: RDSInstanceToSecurityGroupRelProperties = RDSInstanceToSecurityGroupRelProperties()
    ```

    **Composite Node Pattern**: When a data type `A` refers to another data type `B` and offers additional fields about `B` that `B` doesn't have itself, we should define a composite node schema. This composite node would be named "`BASchema`" to denote that it's a "`B`" object as known by an "`A`" object. When loaded, the composite node schema targets the same node label as the primary `B` schema, allowing the loading system to perform a `MERGE` operation that combines properties from both sources.

    For example, in the AWS EC2 module, we have both `EBSVolumeSchema` (from the EBS API) and `EBSVolumeInstanceSchema` (from the EC2 Instance API). The EC2 Instance API provides additional properties about EBS volumes that the EBS API doesn't have, such as `deleteontermination`. Both schemas target the same `AWSEBSVolume` node label, allowing the node to accumulate properties from both sources.

    ```python
    # EC2 Instance provides additional properties about EBS Volumes
    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class EBSVolumeInstanceProperties(CartographyNodeProperties):
        id: PropertyRef = PropertyRef("VolumeId")
        arn: PropertyRef = PropertyRef("Arn", extra_index=True)
        lastupdated: PropertyRef = PropertyRef("lastupdated", set_in_kwargs=True)
        # Additional property that EBS API doesn't have
        deleteontermination: PropertyRef = PropertyRef("DeleteOnTermination")

    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class EBSVolumeInstanceSchema(CartographyNodeSchema):
        label: str = "AWSEBSVolume"  # Same label as EBSVolumeSchema
        properties: EBSVolumeInstanceProperties = EBSVolumeInstanceProperties()
        sub_resource_relationship: EBSVolumeToAWSAccountRel = EBSVolumeToAWSAccountRel()
        # ... other relationships
    ```

    The key distinction is whether the referring module provides additional properties about the target entity. If it does, use a composite node schema. If it only provides IDs, use a simple relationship schema.

    In case you're curious, here's some [historical context](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/issues/1210) on how we got here.
