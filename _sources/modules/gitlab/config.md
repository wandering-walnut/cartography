# GitLab Configuration

## Prerequisites

1. A GitLab instance (self-hosted or gitlab.com)
2. A GitLab personal access token with the required scopes (see below)
3. The numeric ID of the GitLab organization (top-level group) to sync

## Authentication

### Personal access token

1. Navigate to your GitLab instance (e.g., `https://gitlab.com` or `https://gitlab.example.com`)
2. Go to **User Settings**, then **Access Tokens** (or directly to `https://your-gitlab-instance/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens`)
3. Click **Add new token**
4. Configure your token:
   - **Token name**: `cartography-sync`
   - **Scopes**: Select `read_user`, `read_repository`, and `read_api`
   - **Expiration date**: Set according to your security policy
5. Click **Create personal access token**
6. Copy the token immediately. You will not be able to see it again.

## Required Permissions

The token requires the following scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `read_user` | Access user profile information for group/project membership |
| `read_repository` | Access repository metadata, branches, and file contents |
| `read_api` | Access groups, projects, dependency scanning artifacts, language statistics, and group/project-level CI/CD runners |

These scopes provide read-only access to:
- Organizations (top-level groups) and nested groups
- Projects and their metadata
- Branches and default branch information
- Dependencies extracted from GitLab dependency scanning artifacts
- Project language statistics
- Group-level and project-level CI/CD runners

Dependency scanning artifact access:

Cartography ingests GitLab dependencies from CycloneDX SBOM artifacts produced by GitLab dependency scanning jobs, not from GitLab's dependency list API. The token scopes above are required, and the token's user must also be allowed to download CI job artifacts for each project.

GitLab projects can restrict artifact downloads with [`artifacts:access`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#artifactsaccess). If a dependency scanning job uses `artifacts:access: developer` or `artifacts:access: maintainer`, a token that belongs to a Reporter-level user can receive `403 Forbidden` when Cartography downloads the job artifacts. Grant the token's user a project role that satisfies the artifact access policy.

Dependency scanning jobs must produce CycloneDX SBOM artifacts, such as `gl-sbom-*.cdx.json`, `gl-sbom.cdx.json`, or gzipped equivalents. GitLab documents these SBOMs as job artifacts of the dependency scanning job. Cartography can only ingest artifacts that GitLab still serves, so expired or deleted job artifacts cannot be recovered during sync.

## Optional Permissions

Listing **instance-level** (shared) runners via `GET /api/v4/runners/all` requires the token to belong to a GitLab administrator. If the token does not have admin privileges, the sync logs a warning and skips instance-level runners; group-level and project-level runners continue to be ingested normally.

CI config (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) ingestion:

The CI config sync first calls `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/ci/lint?dry_run=true` to obtain the merged YAML with all `include:` references expanded. Tokens generated from a user without Maintainer access on the project may not be allowed to use this endpoint. In that case, the sync falls back to the raw `.gitlab-ci.yml` from the repository, which only requires `read_repository`. If both calls fail with 404 or 403, the project is skipped and a warning is logged.

## Configure Cartography

The organization ID is the numeric ID of the top-level GitLab group you want to sync. To find it:

1. Navigate to your group's page on GitLab (e.g., `https://gitlab.com/your-organization`).
2. Click the **⋮** (three dots) menu in the top right of the group header and select **Copy group ID**.
3. Alternatively, fetch it via the API:
   ```bash
   curl -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: your-token" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/your-organization"
   ```
   The `id` field in the response is your organization ID.

Set your GitLab token in an environment variable:

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-your-token-here"
```

## Run Cartography

```bash
cartography \
  --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687 \
  --selected-modules gitlab \
  --gitlab-organization-id 12345678 \
  --gitlab-token-env-var GITLAB_TOKEN
```

## Advanced Configuration

| Parameter | CLI Argument | Environment Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| GitLab URL | `--gitlab-url` | N/A | No | `https://gitlab.com` | The GitLab instance URL. Only set for self-hosted instances. |
| GitLab Token | `--gitlab-token-env-var` | Set by you | Yes | N/A | Name of the environment variable containing your GitLab personal access token |
| Organization ID | `--gitlab-organization-id` | N/A | Yes | N/A | The numeric ID of the top-level GitLab group (organization) to sync |
| Commit history | `--gitlab-commits-since-days` | N/A | No | `90` | Number of days of commit history to fetch |

For a self-hosted GitLab instance:

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-abc123xyz"

cartography \
  --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687 \
  --selected-modules gitlab \
  --gitlab-url "https://gitlab.example.com" \
  --gitlab-organization-id 12345678 \
  --gitlab-token-env-var "GITLAB_TOKEN"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Connection timeout:**
- Default timeout is 60 seconds
- For slow GitLab instances, the sync may take longer during language detection
- Check GitLab instance health if repeated timeouts occur

**Missing language data:**
- Some projects may not have language statistics available (empty repos, binary-only repos)
- Errors fetching languages for individual projects are logged as warnings but don't stop the sync

**Missing dependency data:**
- Ensure GitLab Dependency Scanning is enabled for the project.
- Confirm its jobs produce retained CycloneDX SBOM artifacts and that the
  token's user can download them.

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure your token has all required scopes: `read_user`, `read_repository`, `read_api`
- Verify the token hasn't expired
- Check that the GitLab user has access to the organization and projects you want to sync

**Organization not found:**
- Verify the `--gitlab-organization-id` is the correct numeric ID (not the group path)
- Ensure the token's user has access to the organization
