## Cross-Platform Integration: Okta to AWS

When Okta is configured as the SAML identity provider for AWS Identity Center,
Cartography can represent this access path:

```cypher
(:OktaUser)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)-[:ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML]->(:AWSRole)
```

Cartography links an `OktaUser` to an `AWSSSOUser` when
`AWSSSOUser.external_id` matches `OktaUser.id`. CloudTrail management events
record role assumptions from AWS Identity Center as `ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML`
relationships.
