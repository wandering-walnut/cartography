- `(:S1Account)-[:RESOURCE]->(:S1Agent)`: Links a SentinelOne account to one of its agents.

### S1AppFinding

A vulnerability finding for software on a SentinelOne endpoint.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node uses the ontology label [`CVE`](#ontology-cve).

> **Additional Labels**: This node also uses `Risk`, `S1Finding`.

> **Additional Label Definitions**:
>
> - `Risk`: A node participating in the shared Risk graph interface.
> - `S1Finding`: A sentinelone node participating in the shared S1Finding graph interface.
