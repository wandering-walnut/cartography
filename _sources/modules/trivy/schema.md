### TrivyFix

A package version that fixes a Trivy vulnerability finding.

> **Additional Labels**: This node also uses `Fix`.

> **Additional Label Definitions**:
>
> - `Fix`: A node participating in the shared Fix graph interface.

#### Properties

| Field | Index | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| id | Yes | Unique Trivy fix ID. |
| firstseen |  | Timestamp when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Yes | Timestamp of the last sync that observed this node. |
| version |  | Package version that fixes the vulnerability. |

#### Relationships

- `(:TrivyFix)-[:APPLIES_TO]->(:TrivyImageFinding)`: Links a Trivy fix to the finding it resolves.

- `(:PackageVersion)-[:SHOULD_UPDATE_TO]->(:TrivyFix)`: A canonical package version should be updated to an available Trivy fix.

- `(:TrivyPackage)-[:SHOULD_UPDATE_TO]->(:TrivyFix)`: Links a vulnerable package to the version that fixes it.
  - Properties:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | version | Package version that fixes the vulnerability. |

### TrivyImageFinding

A vulnerability finding detected by Trivy in a scan target.

> **Additional Labels**: This node also uses `Risk`.

> **Additional Label Definitions**:
>
> - `Risk`: A node participating in the shared Risk graph interface.

> **Conditional Labels**:
>
> - [`CVE`](#ontology-cve) (ontology label) when `has_cve` equals `true`. A cross-provider CVE resource in Cartography's ontology.
