# Quick start: Install and Run Cartography On Test Machine

Time to set up a test machine to run Cartography.

## Option 1: Run docker-compose (preferred)

This is the quickest way to get started: you will run a cartography cron job and a Neo4j docker container on your
machine to pull data from AWS.

![dockercompose-flow.png](images/dockercompose-flow.png)

1. Clone the Cartography repo to your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:cartography-cncf/cartography.git
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography
    ```

1. **Start up the Neo4j graph database.**

    ```bash
    cd cartography
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    If this command errors out with permission problems, you may need to configure your Docker Desktop/Rancher Desktop/etc to use a different virtual machine volume setting: try virtiofs on Mac.

    It may take a minute for the Neo4j container to spin up.

1. **Configure and run Cartography.**

    In this example we will run Cartography on [AWS](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/aws/config.html) with a profile called "1234_testprofile" and default region set to "us-east-1".

    ```bash
    docker-compose run \
        -e AWS_PROFILE=1234_testprofile \
        -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
        cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://cartography-neo4j-1:7687
    ```

    If you get a connection error like `ValueError: Cannot resolve address cartography-neo4j-1:7687`, you may need to wait a bit for the Neo4j container to be ready. Run `docker ps` periodically to check on it and then retry the `docker-compose run ..` command.

    You will know it works when your terminal shows log messages displaying how many assets are being loaded to the graph:

    ![docker-compose-run.png](images/docker-compose-run.png)

    **Notes:**
    - You can view a full list of Cartography's CLI arguments by running `docker-compose run cartography --help`.

    - Refer to the configuration sections of the relevant intel modules - such as [AWS](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/aws/index.html), [GCP](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/gcp/index.html), [Azure](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/azure/index.html), and others - to properly set up each data source. The instructions for configuring additional modules can be found in the sidebar menu under the "Intel Modules" section. This generally involves specifying environment variables to cartography, or making a config/credential file on the host available to the container.

        - You can pass in environment variables to the cartography container using the docker-compose format like this: `-e VARIABLE1 -e VARIABLE2=value2`.
        - You can make files available to the cartography container by editing the volumes in the docker-compose.yml file. See docker-compose documentation on how to do that.

    - `cartography-neo4j-1` is how the Cartography docker container knows how to reach the Neo4j container in docker-compose.

    - AWS things

        - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` must be specified.
        - The docker-compose.yml maps in `~/.aws/` on your host machine to `/var/cartography/.aws` in the cartography container so that the container has access to AWS profile and credential files.
        - You can use `--aws-requested-syncs` to sync only specific AWS resources instead of all of them. This accepts a comma-separated list of resource identifiers. For example, to sync only EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and IAM resources: `--aws-requested-syncs "ec2:instance,s3,iam"`. See [AWS Configuration](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/aws/config.html#selective-syncing-with---aws-requested-syncs) for the full list of available resources.

1. **Run security frameworks against your graph.**

    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint cartography-rules cartography run all --uri bolt://cartography-neo4j-1:7687
    ```

    Full docs [here](usage/rules).

1. **View the graph.**

   You can view the graph while it is still syncing by visiting http://localhost:7474. Try a query like

    ```cypher
    match (i:AWSRole)--(c:AWSAccount) return *
   ```

    It should look like this:

    ![dockercompose-result.png](images/dockercompose-result.png)

1. **Optional**: If you want to configure the Neo4j container itself, you can do this via the `.compose` directory, which is
git ignored. neo4j config, logs, etc are all located at `.compose/neo4j/...`

1. **Optional**: You can supply additional environment variables via `docker-compose` like this:
    ```bash
    # Temporarily disable bash command history
    set +o history
    # See the cartography github configuration intel module docs
    export GITHUB_KEY=BASE64ENCODEDKEY
    # You need to set this after starting neo4j once, and resetting
    # the default neo4j password, which is neo4j
    export NEO4j_PASSWORD=...
    # Reenable bash command history
    set -o history
    # Start cartography dependencies
    docker-compose up -d
    # Run cartography
    docker-compose run -e GITHUB_KEY -e NEO4j_PASSWORD cartography cartography --github-config-env-var GITHUB_KEY --neo4j-uri bolt://neo4j:7687 --neo4j-password-env-var NEO4j_PASSWORD --neo4j-user neo4j
    ```

## Option 2: manually run 2 containers

1. **Run the Neo4j graph database container.**

    ```bash
    # Create a docker network so that cartography can talk to neo4j
    docker network create cartography-network

    # run the Neo4j graph database
    docker run \
        --publish=7474:7474 \
        --publish=7687:7687 \
        --network cartography-network \
        -v data:/data \
        --name cartography-neo4j \
        --env=NEO4J_AUTH=none \
        neo4j:5-community
    ```

    - Refer to the Neo4j Docker [official docs](https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j) for more information.

    - Note that we are just playing around here on a test instance and have specified `--env=NEO4J_AUTH=none` to turn off authentication.

    - If you experience very slow write performance using an ARM-based machine like an M1 Mac, see if using an ARM image helps. Neo4j keeps ARM builds [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/arm64v8/neo4j/).

1. **Configure and run Cartography.**

    See the configuration section of [each relevant intel module](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules) to set up each data source. In this example we will use [AWS](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/aws/config.html).

    This command runs cartography on an AWS profile called "1234_testprofile" on region us-east-1. We also expose the host machine's ~/.aws directory to ~/var/cartography/.aws in the container so that AWS configs work.

     ```bash
    docker run --rm \
        --network cartography-network \
        -v ~/.aws:/var/cartography/.aws/ \
        -e AWS_PROFILE=1234_testprofile \
        -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
        ghcr.io/cartography-cncf/cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://cartography-neo4j:7687
     ```

   If things work, your terminal will look like this where you see log messages displaying how many assets are being loaded to the graph:

    ![docker-compose-run.png](images/docker-compose-run.png)

    ### Notes:

    - You pass in environment variables to the cartography container using the docker format like this: `-e VARIABLE1 -e VARIABLE2=value2`.

    - AWS things

      - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` must be specified.
      - Our docker-compose.yml maps in `~/.aws/` on your host machine to `/var/cartography/.aws` in the cartography container, so the container has access to AWS profile and credential files.
    - You can view a full list of Cartography's CLI arguments by running `docker run ghcr.io/cartography-cncf/cartography --help`.

1. **Run security frameworks against your graph.**

    ```bash
    docker run --rm --network cartography-network --entrypoint cartography-rules ghcr.io/cartography-cncf/cartography run all --uri bolt://cartography-neo4j:7687
    ```

    Full docs [here](usage/rules).

1. **View the graph.**

    ```cypher
    match (i:AWSRole)--(c:AWSAccount) return *

Read on to see [other things you can do with Cartography](#things-to-do-next).

## Option 3: Native install

Do this if you prefer to install and manage all the dependencies yourself. Cartography _should_ work on Linux, Mac, and Windows, but bear in mind we haven't tested much on Windows so far.

![yourowntestmachine.png](images/yourowntestmachine.png)

1. **Ensure that you have Python 3.13 set up on your machine.**

    Python 3.11 and 3.12 may work but are not tested. Python 3.10 and older are not supported.

1. **Run Neo4j graph database version 5.23 or higher.** Cartography emits scoped subqueries (`CALL (var) { ... }`) that earlier 5.x releases do not support.

    1. We recommend running Neo4j as a Docker container so that you save time and don't need to install Java. Run `docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 -v data:/data --env=NEO4J_AUTH=none neo4j:5-community`.

    1. Otherwise, if you prefer to **install Neo4j from scratch**,

        1. Neo4j requires a JVM (JDK/JRE 17 or higher). One option is [Amazon Coretto 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/what-is-corretto-17.html).

            ⚠️ Make sure you have the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set. The following works for Mac OS: `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`

        1. Go to the [Neo4j download page](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community), and download Neo4j Community Edition 5.23 or higher.

        1. [Install](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) Neo4j.

            ⚠️ For local testing, you might want to turn off authentication via property `dbms.security.auth_enabled` in file NEO4J_PATH/conf/neo4j.conf

            💡 If you leave authentication enabled, Neo4j uses the default credentials:

            - **Username**: `neo4j`
            - **Password**: `neo4j` (you will be prompted to change it on first login)

            You can also provide credentials to Cartography via command-line flags or environment variables. For example:

            ```bash
            export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-password"
            cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687 --neo4j-user neo4j --neo4j-password-env-var NEO4J_PASSWORD
            ```

1. **Install cartography with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).**

    Cartography uses uv for development and CI. We recommend it for installation as well: it manages an isolated environment for you and is significantly faster than pip.

    ```bash
    # Install uv if you don't have it (see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ for alternatives).
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Install cartography as an isolated tool exposed on your PATH.
    uv tool install cartography
    ```

    Use `uv tool upgrade cartography` to pull in new releases.

    If you prefer pip, `pip install cartography` still works inside a venv. See the [Python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) for venv setup with `pyenv` / `pyenv-virtualenv`.

    ```{tip}
    Install `cartography[neo4j-rust]` instead of `cartography` to get a faster Neo4j driver. See [Faster Neo4j driver](ops.md#faster-neo4j-driver).
    ```

1. **Configure your data sources.**

    See the configuration section of [each relevant intel module](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules) for more details. In this example we will use [AWS](https://docs.cartography.dev/modules/aws/config.html).

1. **Run cartography.**

    - For a specific AWS account defined as a separate profile in your AWS config file, set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, for example this command runs cartography on an AWS profile called "1234_testprofile" on region us-east-1.

        ```bash
        AWS_PROFILE=1234_testprofile AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687
        ```

    - For one account using the `default` profile defined in your AWS config file, run

        ```bash
        cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687
        ```

    - For more than one AWS account, run

        ```bash
        AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/your/aws/config cartography --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7687 --aws-sync-all-profiles
        ```

    You can view a full list of Cartography's CLI arguments by running `cartography --help`.

    ```{tip}
    Use `--selected-modules` with `--help` to see only relevant options: `cartography --selected-modules aws --help` shows only AWS-related options. See [CLI documentation](usage/cli) for shell autocompletion setup.
    ```

    If everything worked, the sync will pull data from your configured accounts and ingest data to Neo4j! This process might take a long time if your account has a lot of assets.

1. **Run security frameworks against your graph.**

    ```bash
    cartography-rules run all
    ```

    This command needs no password for the no-auth Neo4j container used in this
    guide. If your Neo4j server requires authentication, set
    `NEO4J_PASSWORD` before running it, use `--neo4j-password-env-var NAME`, or
    request an interactive prompt with `--neo4j-password-prompt`.

    Full docs [here](usage/rules).

1. **View the graph.**
    You can view the graph while it is still syncing by visiting http://localhost:7474. Try a query like

    ```cypher
    match (i:AWSRole)--(c:AWSAccount) return *
   ```

    It should look like this:
